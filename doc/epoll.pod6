=head1 NAME

epoll

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use epoll;

  my $epoll = epoll.new(maxevents => 1); # 1 is default

  $epoll.add($file-descriptor, :in, :out, :priority, :edge-triggered);

  # timeout in milliseconds, default -1 = block forever
  for $epoll.wait(:2000timeout)
  {
      say "{.fd} is ready for reading" if .in;
      say "{.fd} is ready for writing" if .out;
  }

  # Or use chained calls:

  for epoll.new.add(0, :in).wait
  {
      say "ready to read on {.fd}" if .in;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Simple low level interface around the Linux epoll(7) I/O event
notification facility.  It can monitor multiple file descriptors to
see if I/O is possible on any of them.  Mainly useful for interfacing
with other NativeCall modules, since Perl itself has a rich I/O
system.  If you really want to use this with Perl C<IO::Handle>s, you
can use C<native-descriptor()> to get a suitable descriptor.

=head2 class B<epoll>

=item method B<new>(:$maxevents = 1)

Create a new epoll object.  Maxevents is the maximum number of events
that can be returned from a single call to wait.

=item method B<add>(int32 $file-descriptor, ...event flags...)

  Flags:
    :in             = EPOLLIN       = ready for read
    :out            = EPOLLOUT      = ready for write
    :priority       = EPOLLPRI      = urgent data available for read
    :edge-triggered = EPOLLET       = Edge Triggered
    :one-shot       = EPOLLONESHOT  = Disables after 1 event
    :mod            = EPOLL_CTL_MOD = Modify an existing file descriptor

:mod is equivalent to EPOLL_CTL_MOD to change the events for a file
descriptor already added.  It will also re-enable a file descriptor
disabled by :one-shot mode.

For convenience, always returns the object itself, so you can chain
calls.

=item method B<remove>(int32 $file-descriptor)

Remove a file descriptor previously added.

=item method B<wait>(int32 :$timeout = -1)

Wait for 1 or more events to occur on the add()ed file descriptors.
You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds.

Returns a List of up up to $maxevents B<epoll-event>s.

=head2 class B<epoll-event>

=item method int32 B<fd>()

The file descriptor for the event.

=item method uint32 B<events>()

A bitmask of the events that occurred.  You can check them like this:

if $event.events +& EPOLLIN {...}

or use the much easier:

=item method Bool B<in>()

Ready to read

=item method Bool B<out>()

Ready to write

=head2 EXCEPTIONS

Throws Ad-hoc exceptions for any errors.

(Should save errno, and make real Exceptions -- patches welcome!)

=head2 NOTE

epoll is a Linux specific mechanism, and is typically not available on
other architectures.
