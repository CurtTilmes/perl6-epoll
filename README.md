epoll - I/O event notification facility

SYNOPSIS
========

    use epoll;

    my $epoll = epoll.new(maxevents => 1); # 1 is default

    $epoll.add($file-descriptor, :in, :out, :priority, :edge-triggered);

    # timeout in milliseconds, default -1 = block forever
    for $epoll.wait(:2000timeout)
    {
        say "{.fd} is ready for reading" if .in;
        say "{.fd} is ready for writing" if .out;
    }

    # Or use chained calls:

    for epoll.new.add(0, :in).wait
    {
        say "ready to read on {.fd}" if .in;
    }

DESCRIPTION
===========

Simple low level interface around the Linux `epoll(7)` I/O event notification facility. It can monitor multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them. Mainly useful for interfacing with other NativeCall modules, since Perl itself has a rich I/O system. If you really want to use this with Perl `IO::Handle`s, you can use `native-descriptor()` to get a suitable descriptor.

class **epoll**
---------------

  * method **new**(:$maxevents = 1)

Create a new epoll object. Maxevents is the maximum number of events that can be returned from a single call to wait.

  * method **add**(int32 $file-descriptor, ...event flags...)

    Flags:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>:in</td>
    <td>EPOLLIN</td>
    <td>ready for read</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>:out</td>
    <td>EPOLLOUT</td>
    <td>ready for write</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>:priority</td>
    <td>EPOLLPRI</td>
    <td>urgent data available for read</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>:edge-triggered</td>
    <td>EPOLLET</td>
    <td>Edge Triggered</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>:one-shot</td>
    <td>EPOLLONESHOT</td>
    <td>Disables after 1 event</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>:mod</td>
    <td>EPOLL_CTL_MOD</td>
    <td>Modify an existing file descriptor</td>
  </tr>
</table>

:mod is equivalent to EPOLL_CTL_MOD to change the events for a file descriptor already added. It will also re-enable a file descriptor disabled by :one-shot mode.

For convenience, always returns the object itself, so you can chain calls.

  * method **remove**(int32 $file-descriptor)

Remove a file descriptor previously added.

  * method **wait**(int32 :$timeout = -1)

Wait for 1 or more events to occur on the add()ed file descriptors. You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds.

Returns a List of up up to $maxevents **epoll-event**s.

class **epoll-event**
---------------------

  * method int32 **fd**()

The file descriptor for the event.

  * method uint32 **events**()

A bitmask of the events that occurred. You can check them like this:

if $event.events +& EPOLLIN {...}

or use the much easier:

  * method Bool **in**()

Ready to read

  * method Bool **out**()

Ready to write

EXCEPTIONS
----------

Throws Ad-hoc exceptions for any errors.

(Should save errno, and make real Exceptions -- patches welcome!)

NOTE
----

epoll is a Linux specific mechanism, and is typically not available on other architectures.
